LocalReads
=====================

LocalReads helps you list your paper books in an online shelf and tag a location to the shelf. When you and more of your friends and neighbors create shelves, you will start seeing Books owned by people in your neighborhood. You can request for a book from a neighbor and exchange your books to read new ones.

LocalReads is also an open source app.

The front-end Android app is built completely using Ionic Framework and AngularJS technologies. Developers who want to build similar apps or extend LocalReads can check the source code in this repository.
