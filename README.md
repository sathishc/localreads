LocalReads
=====================

LocalReads helps you list your paper books in an online shelf and tag a location to the shelf. When you and more of your friends and neighbors create shelves, you will start seeing Books owned by people in your neighborhood. You can request for a book from a neighbor and exchange your books to read new ones.


## Using this project

LocalReads is also an open source app.

The front-end Android app is built completely using Ionic Framework and AngularJS technologies. Developers who want to build similar apps or extend LocalReads can check the source code in this repository.

The back-end used for LocalReads is Grails framework with MongoDB backend. The source code repository is at https://github.com/sathishc/localreads-service

The projects use BDD/TDD style development. The front-end uses Protractor for e2e and Karma for unit tests. The backend-end grails code uses the spock library for tests
