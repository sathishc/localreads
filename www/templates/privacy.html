      <div><p><strong>We take your privacy seriously.</strong> Below you will find our policy. Square Prism Pvt Limited. is the corporate name for MediaNearby.</p>            <h3>MediaNearby Privacy Policy</h3>         <p>Effective January 2012</p>         <p>Square Prism Pvt Ltd. ('Square Prism', 'our', 'us' or 'we') provides this Privacy Policy to inform you of our policies and procedures regarding the collection, use and disclosure of personal information we receive from users of <a href="https://www.MediaNearby.com/">www.MediaNearby.com</a> (this 'Site') and our corresponding application for mobile devices (the 'Application'). This Privacy Policy applies only to information that you provide to us through the Site and Application. This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time. We will notify you of any material changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on the Site or via the Application. You are advised to consult this policy regularly for any changes. Unless otherwise defined in this Privacy Policy, terms used in this Privacy Policy have the same meanings as in our MediaNearby <a href="/terms" class="mnMenu"> Terms of Service</a>.</p>         <p>As used in this policy, the terms 'using' and 'processing' information include using cookies on a computer, subjecting the information to statistical or other analysis and using or handling information in any way, including, but not limited to collecting, storing, evaluating, modifying, deleting, using, combining, disclosing and transferring information within our organization or among our affiliates within the United States or internationally.</p>          <dl>         <dt>Information Collection and Use</dt>         <p>Our primary goals in collecting information are to provide and improve our Site, Application, services, features and content, to administer your membership (together, the 'Service') and to enable users to enjoy and easily navigate the Site and Application.</p>          <dt>Personally Identifiable Information.</dt>         <p>When you register with us through the Site or Application to become a Member of MediaNearby, we will ask you for personally identifiable information. This refers to information about you that can be used to contact or identify you ('Personal Information'). Personal Information includes, but is not limited to, your name, free-form biography, website and email address. You can register to join MediaNearby via the Site or Application or by logging into your account with certain third party social networking sites ('SNS') (including, but not limited to, Facebook and Twitter) via our Site. If you decide to create your Account by logging into a SNS via the Site, we will extract the Personal Information you have provided to the SNS (such as your 'real' name, email address and other information you make publicly available via the SNS) from the account you have with such SNS and use that information to create your Account; the information we extract may depend on the privacy settings you have with the SNS. For example, our Service allows users to create an account and login to the Service using their Facebook account credentials through Facebook Connect. If you are not currently registered as a Member and you click on 'Sign in Using Facebook,' you will first be asked to enter your Facebook credentials and then be given the option to register and join MediaNearby. By using Facebook Connect, you are allowing MediaNearby to access your Facebook account information and you are agreeing to the Facebook Terms of Use regarding your use of the Service via Facebook.</p>         <ul>             <li>We use your Personal Information mainly to provide the Service and administer your inquiries. We will create your Account for your use of the Site and Application based upon the Personal Information you provide and you will become a Member of MediaNearby.</li>             <li>We also collect the other information that you provide as part of registration and the administration and personalization of your profile webpage on MediaNearby (e.g., without limitation, age and individual preferences) ('Non-Identifying Information').</li>             <li>We use your Personal Information (in some cases, in conjunction with your Non-Identifying Information) mainly to provide the Service, complete your transactions, and administer your inquiries.</li>             <li>Certain Non-Identifying Information would be considered a part of your Personal Information if it were combined with other identifiers (for example, combining your zip code with your street address) in a way that enables you to be identified. But the same pieces of information are considered Non-Identifying Information when they are taken alone or combined only with other non-identifying information (for example, your viewing preferences). We may combine your Personal Information with Non-Identifying Information and aggregate it with information collected from other MediaNearby Users (defined below) to attempt to provide you with a better experience, to improve the quality and value of the Service and to analyze and understand how our Site, Application and Service are used. We may also use the combined information without aggregating it to serve you specifically, for instance to deliver a product to you according to your preferences or restrictions.</li>             <li>We also use your Personal Information to contact you with MediaNearby newsletters, marketing or promotional materials and other information that may be of interest to you. If you decide at any time that you no longer wish to receive such communications from us, please follow the unsubscribe instructions provided in any of the communications or update your 'preferences' information. (See 'Changing or Deleting Information,' below.)</li>             <li>Log Data. When you visit the Site or Application, whether as a Member or a non-registered user just browsing (any of these, a 'MediaNearby User'), our servers automatically record information that your browser sends whenever you visit a website ('Log Data'). This Log Data may include information such as the browser type or the webpage you were visiting before you came to our Site and Application, pages of our Site and Application that you visit, the time spent on those pages, information you search for on our Site and Application, access times and dates, and other statistics. We use this information to monitor and analyze use of the Site, Application and the Service and for the Site and Application’s technical administration, to increase our Site and Application’s functionality and user-friendliness, and to better tailor our Site and Application to our visitors’ needs. For example, some of this information is collected so that when you visit the Site and Application again, it will recognize you and serve advertisements and other information appropriate to your interests. We also use this information to verify that visitors to the Site and Application meet the criteria required to process their requests. [We do not treat Log Data as Personal Information or use it in association with other Personal Information, though we may aggregate, analyze and evaluate such information for the same purposes as stated above regarding other Non-Identifying Information.</li>         </ul>          <dt>Cookies</dt>         <p>Like many websites, our Site and Application use 'cookies' to collect information. A cookie is a small data file that we transfer to your computer or mobile device’s hard disk for record-keeping purposes. We use cookies for two purposes. First, we utilize persistent cookies to save your login information for future logins to the Site and Application. Second, we utilize session ID cookies to enable certain features of the Site and Application, to better understand how you interact with the Site and Application and to monitor aggregate usage by MediaNearby Users and web traffic routing on the Site and Application. Unlike persistent cookies, session cookies are deleted from your computer when you log off from the Site, Application and Service and then close your browser. Third party advertisers on the Site and Application may also place or read cookies on your browser. You can instruct your browser, by changing its options, to stop accepting cookies or to prompt you before accepting a cookie from the websites you visit. If you do not accept cookies, however, you may not be able to use all portions of the Site and Application or all functionality of the Service.</p>           <dt>Phishing</dt>         <p>Identity theft and the practice currently known as 'phishing' are of great concern to Square Prism. Safeguarding information to help protect you from identity theft is a top priority. We do not and will not, at any time, request your credit card information, login information, or national identification numbers in a non-secure or unsolicited e-mail or telephone communication. For more information about phishing, visit the Federal Trade Commission’s website.</p>          <dt>Information Sharing and Disclosure</dt>         <p>MediaNearby Users. When you register through the Site and Application and submit Personal Information to create a profile or visual collection, MediaNearby Users will see your name. If you choose to provide additional Personal Information in your profile, MediaNearby Users will see such additional Personal Information, including, but not limited to, your photo, location, website and biography. Providing additional Personal Information is voluntary and should correlate with the degree of interaction you want to have with MediaNearby Users. We recommend that you guard your sensitive information.</p>         <p>Aggregate Information and Non-Identifying Information. We may share aggregated information that does not include Personal Information and we may otherwise disclose Non-Identifying Information and Log Data with third parties for industry analysis, demographic profiling and other purposes. Any aggregated information shared in these contexts will not contain your Personal Information.</p>         <p>Service Providers. We may employ third party companies and individuals to facilitate our Service, to provide the Service on our behalf, to perform Site and Application-related services (e.g., without limitation, maintenance services, database management, web analytics and improvement of the Site and Application’s features) or to assist us in analyzing how our Site, Application and Service are used. These third parties have access to your Personal Information only to perform these tasks on our behalf and are obligated not to disclose or use it for any other purpose.</p>         <p>Social Networking Sites. We may share the information in your account (including your Personal Information) with the SNSs that you have linked to your account. These third parties have access to your Personal Information only for this purpose (unless the SNS has received your Personal Information independently of the Service) and are obligated not to disclose or use it for any other purpose.</p>           <dt>Changing or Deleting Your Information</dt>         <p>All Members may review, update, correct or delete the Personal Information in their Account by contacting us or by editing such profile via the Site and Application. If you completely delete all such information, then your Account may become deactivated. We will use commercially reasonable efforts to honor your request. We may retain an archived copy of your records as required by law or for legitimate business purposes.</p>          <dt>Security</dt>         <p>We will make any legally required disclosures of any breach of the security, confidentiality, or integrity of your unencrypted electronically stored 'personal data' (as defined in applicable state statutes on security breach notification) to you via email or conspicuous posting on this Site or via the Application in the most expedient time possible and without unreasonable delay, insofar as consistent with (i) the legitimate needs of law enforcement or (ii) any measures necessary to determine the scope of the breach and restore the reasonable integrity of the data system.</p>          <dt>International Transfer</dt>         <p>Your information may be transferred to — and maintained on — computers located outside of your state, province, country or other governmental jurisdiction where the privacy laws may not be as protective as those in your jurisdiction. If you are located outside the United States and choose to provide information to us, Square Prism transfers Personal Information to the United States and processes it there. Your consent to this Privacy Policy followed by your submission of such information represents your agreement to that transfer.</p>          <dt>Links to Other Sites</dt>         <p>Our Site and Application contains links to other websites. If you choose to visit an advertiser by 'clicking on' a banner ad or other type of advertisement, or click on another third party link, you will be directed to that third party’s website. The fact that we link to a website or present a banner ad or other type of advertisement is not an endorsement, authorization or representation of our affiliation with that third party, nor is it an endorsement of their privacy or information security policies or practices. We do not exercise control over third party websites. These other websites may place their own cookies or other files on your computer, collect data or solicit personal information from you. Other sites follow different rules regarding the use or disclosure of the personal information you submit to them. We encourage you to read the privacy policies or statements of the other websites you visit.</p>          <dt>Our Policy Toward Children</dt>         <p>This Site and Application are not directed to children under 13. We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 13. If a parent or guardian becomes aware that his or her child has provided us with Personal Information without their consent, he or she should contact us at hi@MediaNearby.com If we become aware that a child under 13 has provided us with Personal Information, we will delete such information from our files.</p>          <dt>Contacting Us</dt>         <p>If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, please contact us at <a href="mailto:support@squareprism.com">support@SquarePrism.com</a>.</p>         </dl></div>
